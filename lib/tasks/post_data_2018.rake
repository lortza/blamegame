It POURED on the Krewe of MidCity, which is just mean because Mid City doesn't need any more downpours in its life. As we watched the manhole cover start to bubble, Mike said, 'Mid City: we bring the flooding to you.' #lol #notlol We had so much fun dancing with the Kenner Kitty Cats after the parade and while the street cleaning crews came by. The guy driving the backhoe was getting down to You Can't Touch This and we also had a random dance-off battle happen. It was all so silly and my heart is full of joy." },

I realize that I love this season because I feel so connected with everyone around me and the excitement and joy we're all sharing as a community. I also love that we get to walk around looking ridiculous and just playing all the time. I appreciate this so much about Mardi Gras and New Orleans in general and I am so glad that I've had this in my life." },

      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-02-25', description: "As we, once again, begin conversations about moving, I started thinking about the lessons and gifts I have received from the neighbors on our block. Jotting down just a few here: Sarah: Open your heart and your home to new friends. Michael & Carrie: Love your people fiercely. Ms Claire: Damn! Some southerners really hate people in the North — seemingly on principle. Also, there were Nazi U-Boats in the Mississippi River. Casey of Ruben: It makes a big difference how you choose to engage with the people you see every day. If you choose not to see your neighbors, they notice and they don't like it. If you choose to see your neighbors, they like you. Also, over-entitled behavior is pretty gross. I am sure I look that that to some people. Julia & Josh: Walk the walk you talk about. Julia's friend Ashley: Speak calmly and from a grounded place. Jared & Vaughn: Fling yourself at your passions and ask for help when you need it. Milan: Fuck the system. Fuck the man. Care about people, and cats. John Becky: A person can get away with quite a lot, even when giving 0 fucks about anything in life. Annie: Do the hard work to change the world. Forgive people for their craziness. Shirley: Live life fully. Invite others into your life all the time. Also, raising kittens to be the cats you want them to be can work out. Jarett & Spence: Be friendly, visible, and genuine, and the people will flock to you. Craig: your local pharmacist may have had plenty of schooling, which seems difficult and requires responsibility, but dang, I'll bet prescription mistakes happen more often that we think they do. Pete & Molly: Be a grownup. Be brave enough to let your children go off and play all day and trust that they will be fine." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-04', description: "Last night was neighbor Julia & Josh's wedding (#zuckfest). It has been a long time since we've been to a wedding. It was a lovely intimate event with about 100 people. It was really interesting that of that small group, that 10 of us were neighbors. That's a lot of neighboring up in a small wedding! I felt grateful and honored to be there. Julia tasked people with important things to do that day. It was our job to get the wedding contract home safely, which we did. Mike made an excellent point with how much trust Julia & Josh have to put in their community to allow those tasks to be outsourced." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-08', description: "It has occurred to me that though New Orleans is a friendly city, the actual safety & support I feel (and previously have attributed to the city as a whole) is actually coming from my direct neighbor situation. If we lived one block away in either direction, we'd have a different experience. Well, obviously. Remember the shithole? So that said, anywhere we go will be a step down from our block on Constance." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-08', description: "Mike and I are back in the discussion about moving. I dislike this discussion because I am not looking forward to the stress of starting over again socially as well as the risks of a shitty living situation. But what I realized tonight was that NOLA has served its purpose for us. When we came here, we were a little broken and lonely. NOLA (and as stated above, our direct neighbors) swept us up in a big southern hospitality hug, showed us how to let go and be, and gave us a feeling of safety and groundedness. Also, so many surrogate cats in our life when we knew we could not otherwise have one. I am far more confident in my abilities (in general) and find myself much more skilled at walking into a room of strangers and having an excellent time. I am grateful for the gifts and lessons our time here has given us, and it is okay now to leave. It's going to feel like the breakup of a great romance, but it is okay." },

      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-23', description: "I finally built out a single-page CRUD app — meaning I can now add/edit/update/delete records from the index page of a rails app. This alway felt out-of-reach, but now I know it is something I can do. I spent some time this weekend writing blog posts on how to do it and the process made me understand the methods really well. This was good learning and I really enjoyed it." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-24', description: "Yesterday was the first March For Our Lives, which was a national protest march by students about gun laws. I am so impressed with these students for making change happen. I can't imagine having 'shooter drills' during high school and I didn't realize that was being normalized. Holy shit. The instagram photos of all of the students marching in DC were just phenomenal. Such a great turnout. I am glad I was able to be another supporting body in the crowd." },

We're in a better position this year in terms of expectations and skillset. I'm feeling really excited about meeting new people in a flourishing tech scene. I'm also getting better about letting go of New Orleans." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-25', description: "Yesterday I got to hang out with neighbor Billy and help him with his resume. Later, we hung out at his house and saw his old family pics. His grandparents were in the circus and the old timey photos are incredible. All of his lifeguard stories are interesting too. I am so glad I get to meet and get to know such interesting people." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-29', description: "I just got back from Rouses having done a little experiment. I pretended that I was in a new grocery store in a new city to see how my experience changed. Normally, when I walk around Rouses, I feel like all of the people around me are just neighbors I haven't met yet and that we're all grocery store friends. While pretending to be in a new place, I thought of everyone as strangers. I didn't say hello or interact. I thought of myself as alone and independent. I can see how this approach might make me feel more lonely or less safe in the world. It is fascinating to see what a state of mind can do. I prefer to believe we're all grocery store friends." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-29', description: "I just had a great talk with Aunt Shari. She's concerned about her memory loss, so she's gotten back in to painting, and she just started learning Spanish. I love that she throws herself at whatever it is she wants. Also, that she so open about her gratitude for the people in her life who help her. She's an inspiration." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-30', description: "I was talking with neighbors Julia and Josh across the street. We were talking about how the block is breaking up. They bought a house on the Greenway. Jarett and Spence just moved to Houston. Shirley just moved to MidCity. R000ben just sold his house. Mike and I are moving to Austin. We had a good run! And on my way back to my house (3 houses down) I got to say hello and have conversations with 2 other neighbors. Really feeling connected and neighborly today." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-03-31', description: "We saw Hunt for the Wilderpeople again last night and I just really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the first time we saw it, which was on a couch in the back of a coffee shop in New Orleans. This movie just makes me feel good about life." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-01', description: "Yesterday was a perfect day for walking in the swamp. We pulled up to the Jean Lafitte Nature Preserve Visitors' Center and the parking lot was full, so we went back up the road to another trailhead. It was nearly empty! Annnnnd the walks were mostly on the ground instead of on the raised wooden platforms. It was so nice walking in the quiet. I miss being in nature and I'd love to go camping when we get to Texas." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-08', description: "The Freret Street Festival was today and the weather was perfectly cloudy and a little breezy. There were no lines for the toilets. We got to see an amazing local brass band perform. Mike ate a bun full of meat that he didn't enjoy. In general, we're not into the crowds of festivals, but we had a good time. And then the sky started misting heavily, so we walked home and changed into warmer clothes. We were sleepy and warm and happy and then we went to bed at 8:30. Wow that was nice!" },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-15', description: "Yesterday it rained like crazy. I cleaned out the storm drains on our street the day before so we didn't flood. Though there was a tornado watch, the worst we had was lots of rain and thunder. Today, however, is clear blue and beautiful. The air is crisp and clean and it feels really invigorating outside. I feel sleepy and settled today. It is a nice feeling." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-15', description: "In a couple of weeks, Mike and I are driving to Austin. He'll be driving the truck and I'll be in the car by myself. This means I get to listen to whatever the hell I want to for 10 hours. Yeeehaw! I spent about 40 minutes this morning making an epic 90s playlist for the drive and I enjoyed the process. All of my favorite bands came pouring out of my mind and building the playlist was easy and exciting. I'm looking forward to listening! But right now… Primus." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-21', description: "Friday evening, we had an unexpected visit from former neighbor Annie. Before she arrived, Mike and I were playing Gin Rummy with our kitty cards, which is always a fun way to pass the time. It's relaxing and easy. Then conversation with Annie was so interesting. We learned about her beautiful back yard, the book project she and her intern are making, her plans to move to a healthier place than Mississippi (an undetermined little mountain town in Colorado), and her recent dive into Seminary school where she gets to have respectful conversations about religion. Mike was intrigued and inspired by this idea of Seminary school conversations. Annie talked about her struggles to learn tarot, so I got to show her the decks I made. She was enthralled and played with them for the next 30 minutes or so." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-22', description: "Saturday, we were tired from a late Friday night and not a whole lot of sleep. So we decided do the weekly cooking then instead of on Sunday — leaving Sunday as a day of rest. I knocked out 6 meals by 2pm, which gave us time to ride to Whole Foods to get snacks on our way to the park. It felt so freeing to have Sunday's burden already handled. On the way to the park, we were passed by a couple of random, private-party floats on Magazine, so we stopped to catch beads. The weather was 80s, breezy, and with thick cloud cover, so we enjoyed just being outside. We sat by the pond and enjoyed the pond smell and our olives and cheese. Shortly after we rode home, there was a secondline on our corner. It was a small street party from a neighbor's wedding reception. Michael, Carrie's mom, Sarah, Martin & Julia, Noah & his friend, and Mike and I all hung out on our side of the corner to enjoy the band. Martin broke out beers. This was such a festive and neighborly New Orleans moment. It was beautiful. I will miss it later in life. A couple of hours later, we got to hang out with Carla and BobShaw in their back yard. We listened to music, had wine, and built a bonfire under the twinkle light and citrus tree canopy. It was so peaceful and comfortable there. I enjoyed it immensely. Mike even got in a few clutch guitar lessons from BobShaw. With our upcoming move to Austin heavily on our minds, it is hard not to feel so much that we will miss having friends like this in places like this." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-23', description: "Sunday felt satisfying and relaxing because it was a pre-ordained day of rest. We both slept in, and then I chipped away at tasks I enjoy. I (finally) got in that Bootstrap upgrade for my Tarot app. Then I listened to my new audio book while I repaired the heels of all 4 of our slippers. I was able to get a replacement button for Mike's shirt from a neighbor, so I sewed on 2 buttons that had fallen off. I sat in a sunbeam on the front porch, flipping through a magazine. I walked down to Rouses to get cake fixins and make pumpkin bread from the can of butternut squash that was lingering in the cabinet. It was a restful day and I really enjoyed how relaxing that felt." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-26', description: "Today I built my first React-on-Rails app and it was glorious. Lol. Well, not glorious, but it's the goal I've had all along this means I've completed the core of what I wanted to complete as far as curriculum goes and I'm ready to look for a job. Congratulations to me! This is a graduation moment for me." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-27', description: "Today I built my first Rails API. Hooray! This is a thing I'd been meaning to learn how to do for a long time! I'm really excited about building the separate React app that will consume it." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-04-18', description: "It is a gorgeous Saturday today. I got to ride my bike to Parcels & Post to drop off my last Etsy orders. I got to say thank you and good-bye to Heidi the owner, and that feels really nice. I also got to ride my bike to Ace and just enjoy how quiet, beautiful and slow everything feels today. So much love to NOLA today." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-05-05', description: "Yesterday was a nice, relaxing day. I was up and sitting on the back stoop at about 7am. The sun was warm, the air was humid and smelled like water. It reminded me of early morning at the Outer Banks. As I sat there, just enjoying all of the outdoorness, I realized that termites wings had been floating gently to the ground. Ah yes, last night was the first night of termite season." },

      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-05-13', description: "All week long I just kept saying how proud of myself I am. I'm just so proud of myself. I finally built a Rails API and a separate React app that consumes it. This feels like my school graduation final project and it was my big goal in learning. I've done it and it feels wonderful." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-05-12', description: "We celebrated our 11-year anniversary with dinner at Fry & Pie in the Marigny followed by petting kitties at the cat cafe. After that, we heard fantastic music at a few different clubs on Frenchman. This time, we brought earplugs and it made all of the difference in the world. It was such a nice evening and we were feeling really in love with New Orleans. The hot garbage smell, the blue stuff, the street band playing outside Dat Dog, doing the wifi hover at Starbucks to catch an uber home." },
      { post_type_id: gratitude.id, date: '2018-05-13', description: "I'm grateful that my short stint at Mudbug gave Mike and me a 'home base' when we go out in the French Quarter. It's where we park our bikes, use the bathroom, and use the wifi. It's a nice AC respite on a hot day. Who would have thought that the lasting gift of my time there would be this rest stop for us?" },

I'm grateful that though our Airbnb has/had a flea infestation, our hosts have not blamed us for it (because it was sourced from their late dog). I'm grateful that though our original realtor was a trainwreck, we found someone kickass immediately thereafter to work with. Both Mike and I have felt really stressed and mentally over-worked (lots of decision fatigue and new information), but we're keeping our shit together. And mostly, we're really excited to be in this vibrant new city. We see people with energy, who look like us, doing things and it makes us feel excited to join in and step up our game." },

Personally, I think this sort of silly production is more in line with The Bard's original performances than the super serious ones. It was only 2 miles from our house, so afterward, we got to enjoy the walk home in perfect, overcast weather.

At the Ruby meetup, when I said I was concerned that a position I applied for might not have enough mentor support, they said 'that's what we're for'. Then Youssef offered to make a recommendation on my behalf. He did and what he said was 'I might say something like this: 'Anne feels that she might not be considered for the job because she’s not experienced enough, but you should still consider her for the position because she’s eager and ambitious so she will be up to the challenge, and she has the entire Austin ruby community behind her for support and mentorship if required.''

The parkway East in Pgh was closed (at the Bathtub), as was the 10th street bridge, and other things. Even though I don't feel like I know Pittsburgh all that well, we had lived there for a couple of years and we were able to draw upon our local knowledge to choose a good path to the airport. It took us 2.5 hours to get there, but we made it to our gate just as it was boarding.
